# Turkish-Flag-SVG
Flag of the Republic of Turkey rendered in SVG according to the geometric specifications described in Turkish law. It utilizes the [SVG.js](http://svgjs.com/) library to render the SVG elements. The crescent is a couple overlapping circles. The star is created by defining a circle as a bounding box, then using parametric equations to calculate the points required for a pentagram star.
